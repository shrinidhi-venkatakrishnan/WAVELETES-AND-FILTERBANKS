function [C, S, wc] = discreteWavletTrans(I, J, lpfCoeff)
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% function to compute discrete wavelet transform at level J of an image using provided
% low pass filter coefficients
%
% Input
% I           -       input image
% J           -       Number of levels
% lpfCoeff    -       Low Pass Filter Coefficients
%
% Output
% C           -       organized as a vector with
%                     A(J), H(J), V(J), D(J),
%                     H(J-1), V(J-1), D(J-1), ...,

%                     where A, H, V, and D are each a row vector.
%                     Each vector is the vector column-wise storage of a matrix.
%                     A contains the approximation coefficients
%                     H contains the horizontal detail coefficients
%                     V contains the vertical detail coefficients
%                     D contains the diagonal detail coefficients
%
